By computing and comparing MD5 hashes of data before and after processing, data engineers can quickly detect any alterations and identify potential data integrity issues.\n",

        "MD5 hashes are widely used for deduplication purposes in data pipelines. When dealing with massive datasets, it is common to encounter duplicate records. By hashing the data and storing the MD5 hashes in a lookup table, you can efficiently identify and remove duplicates during data ingestion.\n",

        "###3. Generating Unique Identifiers:\n",
        "As seen in our code example, MD5 hashing can generate unique identifiers (e.g., cost_id) for data records based on specific columns. This is particularly useful when you need to combine data from multiple sources and ensure that each combination results in a consistent and unique identifier.\n",

        "While MD5 hashing has several applications in data workflows, it's essential to acknowledge its limitations. MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and vulnerable to collision attacks, where different inputs produce the same hash value. For cryptographic purposes, stronger hash functions like SHA-256 are recommended."
